# Little Professor - Math Quiz Game

Little Professor is a Python program that implements a math quiz game with three different levels of difficulty. It prompts the user for their chosen level (1, 2, or 3) and then generates ten addition problems based on the selected level. The user has three attempts to answer each problem correctly. If they fail to do so, the correct answer is provided.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your computer.
Installation
### Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
```
shell

Copy code
cd little-professor
```
### Run the program.
```
shell
Copy code
python little_professor.py
```
### Usage

The program will prompt you to select a difficulty level by entering 1, 2, or 3.
You will then be presented with ten math problems. Each problem is in the format X + Y =, where X and Y are non-negative integers.
You have three attempts to solve each problem correctly by entering the answer. If you provide the correct answer within three attempts, you earn a point. Otherwise, the correct answer is displayed.
At the end of the quiz, your score (the number of correct answers out of 10) is displayed.
Example

```
Welcome to Little Professor - The Math Quiz Game!

Enter Level (1, 2 or 3): 2

49 + 73 = 120
120 + 85 = 205
35 + 41 = 76
71 + 37 = 108
22 + 69 = 91
43 + 20 = 63
59 + 31 = 90
59 + 49 = 108
17 + 68 = 85
42 + 77 = 119

Score: 10/10
